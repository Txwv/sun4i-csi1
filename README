Standalone version of libv's sunxi A20 CSI1 driver.

Development of a standalone version was started as it was impossible
to verify the CSI0 functionality of the sunxi csi driver. Even though a 
banana Pi, and the suitable ov5640 camera module were available, this did 
not work out of the box, and the necessary changes needed to make the 
ov5640 work were not public. Why was such code accepted in the kernel?

After spending several weeks with it, dealing with several issues, both on 
the camera side as on the csi side, i gave up and brought up this driver 
from scratch. In the end, I spent less time on this driver than i did on 
trying to make the existing driver work with the other capture 
interface and the OV5640 camera interface.

This tree now moves the driver out of the kernel tree, to ease 
development, and to no longer clash with upstream changes as often.
